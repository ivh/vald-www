<p><b>VALD EMS requests</b>

<p>VALD-EMS requests are ordinary electronic mails, sent via INTERNET to
<pre>
       vald@vald.astro.univie.ac.at 
       vald@astro.uu.se        
       vald@inasan.ru
</pre>
An e-mail for VALD-EMS can either be prepared and sent to any of these VALD 
sites using a standard e-mail program or by using one of the VALD Web 
interfaces (which submit the e-mail to a fixed site, usually that one
running the Web interface).

<p>Each mail can include <b>only one</b> request. The request consists of 
a number of lines. <b>only the first 80 characters of each line are 
interpreted by</b> VALD-EMS. The request starts with a line containing 
a string
<pre>       begin request </pre>
and ends with a line
<pre>       end request </pre>
Spaces are ignored and VALD is case insensitive, so the line
<pre>       EndRequest </pre>
is also a valid termination for the request. All characters on a line of text
in a request to VALD following the symbol # are ignored by VALD. This can be 
used for comments. For example
<pre>       Begin request   # this is a comment for the first line</pre>
All mail is processed at certain times of the day and valid requests
are interpreted and submitted for execution in the order of arrival.
After the request has been processed, the output file is mailed back
to the client. This file contains: VALD-EMS REQUEST NUMBER, all
diagnostic information (syntactic errors, wrong parameter values, etc.)
and the extracted parameters. 
If the client has difficulty identifying the problem with his request, 
he should address the VALD administrator and supply the VALD-EMS request number, 
which appears on the first line of the reply mail.

<p>For the case of larger requests, up to 20000 atomic lines at once, the feature
'via ftp' is available. To invoke it add the line 
<pre>       via ftp</pre>
below the request type. Now the returning e-mail will contain a link where the
resultant data file (gzipped) can be downloaded. Currently this link will be
active for 48 hours.

<p>See examples in Section <a href="reqextall.html">extract all</a>.
