<p align="left"><b>The VALD interface</b>

<p>On top of the VALD-EMS, a World-Wide-Web interface was developed. This
interface allows interactive creation of the request and will notify the
user of inconsistencies or omissions in the request before converting the
request to an ordinary VALD-EMS request.

<p>Another addition to the user interface is the personal configuration
file which was primarily dictated by the quick evolution of the content
of our data base. With the addition of new line data of higher accuracy
it is often impossible to reproduce the same selection with the standard
VALD configuration file that controls the merging of different line lists
according to the ranking system. One can still get the same selection
with the old configuration file, but until VALD2 a user had no control
over the content of the configuration file when using the EMS interface
to access the data base. Now each client can choose between the standard
configuration, created by VALD experts, or a personal configuration file
that is modified only by the owner. A personal configuration file is
first created as a copy of the standard configuration in response to a
VALD-EMS request that contains the 'personal configuration' option or via
the WWW interface. The WWW interface also provides a convenient editing
tool. The VALD client can select a subset of the line lists that will be
searched for extraction requests, set the ranking of different parameters
that determines the merging procedure etc. (see Piskunov et al. 1995,
Ryabchikova et al. 1999, Kupka et al. 1999). The latest copies of the
personal configuration files are automatically distributed to all VALD
servers as part of the synchronization procedure (see below).

<p>The use of mirror sites is a logical way to distribute the work load
and reduce VALD response time. It is particularly important for massive
extraction that is performed, e.g. for model atmosphere calculations.
There are currently three VALD mirror sites in operation, in Vienna,
Uppsala and Moscow. In order to achieve coherence of all VALD servers we
developed an additional layer of the software that runs automatically on
top of the VALD email service and ensures the synchronization of all
sites. Currently, synchronization is performed twice a day which means
that within less than a day after registration a new client will have EMS
access to all VALD sites.

<p>Due to the massive increase off spam mail we recommend that you also
use the  <a href="contact.html">contact page</a> of
the WWW interface when contacting the VALD staff, since we cannot
guarantee that emails sent the traditional way will pass our spam
filters.
