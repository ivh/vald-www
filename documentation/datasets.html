<p><b>VALD data sets</b>

In this section we provide a compilation of all the line lists currently
used within VALD. This list also serves to connect reference labels
provided by VALD--EMS(and termed 'source list') with literature references.

<p>Note that some spectral lines may appear in several of these lists. The 
method of log gf determination for new line data of VALD2 is indicated
as well as the total number of lines in each list. The references 
corresponding to the abbreviations can be found in section 14. 

<p>Currently VALD includes only atomic lines from the following lists:
<a href="$thisscript?docpage=datasets.txt">VALD data sets</a>

<p>The Kurucz <i>Bell light</i> and <i>Bell heavy</i> data are compiled from
the following sources: <a href="$thisscript?docpage=datasets-kur.txt">Kurucz CDROM18 data sets</a>

<p>The wavelengths contained in VALD are in vaccum for 
&#955; < 2000 &#197; and in air from 
&#955; = 2000 &#197; up to the infrared.

<p>VALD is constantly adding more lines, so look for the most recent
version of this document for the actual references and the corresponding
labels. Please take into account that for all modes of data extraction
except for SHOW LINE, data is merged from 
different lists. If you need detailed information on a line from all sources 
known, you have to use the SHOW LINE request, which enables 
you to see how the data from various sources are merged for a particular line.
