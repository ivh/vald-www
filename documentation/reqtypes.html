VALD-EMS  currently supports 4 types of requests

<p><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
 <tr><td width="120px" valign="top" align="left">show line</td>
       <td align="justify">extracts all information, available in VALD, 
           about a specific spectral line (or rather, the same species) in 
           a small wavelength window (several spectral lines from the
           same species could appear in the output).</td></tr>
 <tr><td width="120px" valign="top" align="left">extract all</td>
       <td align="justify">extracts best atomic parameters for all spectral 
           lines in a given spectral window.</td></tr>
 <tr><td width="120px" valign="top" align="left">extract element</td>
       <td align="justify">extracts best atomic parameters for all 
           spectral lines of the particular chemical element or ion in a given
           spectral window.</td></tr>
 <tr><td width="120px" valign="top" align="left">extract stellar</td>
       <td align="justify">extracts all spectral lines (with their best 
           parameters), which produce significant absorption in a stellar
           atmosphere with given effective temperature and gravity.</td></tr>

<p>The type of the request is indicated by one of the keywords, listed above,
placed in the second line of the request. The content of the request
depends on its type as described in the following sections.  Compulsory
parameters are inclosed in angle brackets <...> while optional parameters
are put in square brackets [...].
