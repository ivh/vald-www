<p><b>Extract element</b>

<p>This request must have the following format
<pre>
  begin request
  extract element
  [long format]
  [short format]
  &lt;wavelength 1&gt;,&lt;wavelength 2&gt;
  &lt;element&gt; [spectral number]
  end request
</pre>
where &lt;wavelength 1&gt;,&lt;wavelength 2&gt; are again the limits of the spectral
interval in Angstroem. Only the lines formed by &lt;element&gt; in one or all
ionization stages will be extracted. [spectral number] defines the
ionization stage: 1 stands for neutral atoms, 2 for singly ionized, etc.

<p>Currently VALD includes mostly lines up to the spectral number 5. If
[spectral number] is omitted, the extraction is done for lines up to the
four times ionized atom.

<p>Example
<pre>
   begin request   # Start of the request
   extract element # Request type
   5700, 5720      # Wavelength range in Angstroems
   Fe 3            # Extract all lines of doubly ionized iron
   end request     # End of the request
</pre>
returns: <a href="reqextelm.txt">reqextelm.txt</a>

<p>The mail reply will look similar to the one above, except that only
lines of doubly ionized iron are included and each transition is
supplemented with term designation (short format).
