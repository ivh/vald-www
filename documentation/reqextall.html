<p><b>Extract All</b>

<p>This request must have the following format
<pre>
   begin request
   extract all
   [via ftp]
   [long format]
   [short format]
   &lt;wavelength 1&gt;,&lt;wavelength 2&gt;
   end request
</pre>
where &lt;wavelength 1&gt;,&lt;wavelength 2&gt; are the limits of the spectral interval 
in Angstroems. Note that VALD limits the total number of lines per single 
mail to 1000, therefore the actual extraction may end somewhat shorter 
of &lt;wavelength 2&gt;. [via ftp] allows the extraction of more lines, but the data
will not be sent via e-mail. It has to be downloaded within a certain time span.
[long format] tells VALD to include an extra line of data
with term designation, Lande factors, and accuracy description into the output 
file. [short format] does not include these data and is the default.

<p>Example
<pre>
   begin request          # Start of the request
   extract all            # Request type
   default configuration  # No special configuration
   short format           # Dislay each transition on only one line
   5700, 5701             # Wavelength range in Angstroems
   end request            # End of the request
</pre>
As the result VALD will mail back to the client VALD-EMS request number,
the copy of the request and a subset of spectral lines between 5700 and
5701 Angstroems as shown in the example
<a href="$thisscript?docpage=reqextall.txt">reqextall.txt</a>

<p>Example using the 'via ftp' option.
<pre>
   begin request          # Start of the request
   extract all            # Request type
   via ftp
   default configuration  # No special configuration
   short format           # Dislay each transition on only one line
   5700, 5701             # Wavelength range in Angstroems
   end request            # End of the request
</pre>

<p>The output columns contain element and ionization stage, central wavelength
in Angstroem, excitation in electron--Volts, log(gf), 3 damping constants
in logarithm (radiative, quadratic Stark and van der Waals) per sec
and per perturber at 10000K (in the case of Stark and van der Waals
constants), mean Lande factor and reference labels. Zero in place of a
damping parameter and 99 in place of the Lande factor marks the absence of
the corresponding data in VALD. The labels at the end of each line show
the source of the respective output column. The SHOW LINE request may be
used to find out all values of transition parameters from different VALD
lists and their corresponding ranking, assigned by the VALD team.
