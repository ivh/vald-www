<h3>UPDATE - Improved Fe I line data in VALD</h3>

<p>Recently, new line data for Fe I has become available (Kurucz, 2014). These
data are based on observed (measured) and predicted (calculated) energy
levels, and are a significant improvement over earlier line data (Kurucz, 2007).
Line data from these new linelist are now available in VALD through lists 721
(measured transitions) and 3621 (predicted transitions).

<p>As of today the new line data will be offered by default.

<p>If you want to go back to using the older data from 2007, you can do this
by reenabling the older lists in your personalized <a
href="http://vald.astro.uu.se/~vald/php/vald.php?page=persconf">linelist
configuration</a>. In that case you should disable list 721, and reenable list 720.

<p>Note that your personalized linelist configuration will only be used if you
explicitly select this during extraction (select 'custom' under
'linelist configuration').
