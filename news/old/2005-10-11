<b>VALD news 11th October 2005 (error fix)</b>
<br><br>
Dear VALD users,<br>
                 During the process of data updating on August 30th an
error appeared in the upper Lande-factors for all Cr lines of the list
<i>'GFIRON obs. energy level: Cr'</i>.
We appologize for this error and ask everybody who made a long format
extraction between August 30<sup>th</sup> and October 11<sup>th</sup>
and who needed the Zeeman data, to repeat the extraction procedure.
<br><br>
Best regards<br>The VALD team<br>
