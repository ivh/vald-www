<b>VALD news, 2008 September 25 (personal configuration) </b>
<br />
<br />
We found that inspite of our news messages some of the users do not
update their personal configuration files according to the updated
default.cfg . Therefor these users are not able to retrieve some of
the improved atomic data. 
We ask all the users to update their personal configuration files
before October 1st. Starting from this time some of VALD files will 
be removed from the running instance of the database.
<br />
<br />Best Regards
<br />The VALD Team
