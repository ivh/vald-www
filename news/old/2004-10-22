<br><br>
The VALD WWW interface has been
updated. Due to the recent increase of spam mail
it was necessary to introduce a contact page for
questions, troubleshooting and registering new
email addresses. You can access it via
<br><br>
  http://ams.astro.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/vald/
<br><br>
Please use the interface to contact the VALD team.
We cannot guarantee that our spamrobot does not
delete messages sent with regular email.

Thank you for your understanding<br>The VALD team<br>
