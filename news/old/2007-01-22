<b>VALD news, January 2007 (new service 'via ftp') </b>
<br />
<br />
For the case of larger requests, up to 20000 atomic lines at once, 
the feature 'via ftp' has been developed. When invoked the returning
e-mail will contain a link where the resultant data file (gzipped) 
can be downloaded. Currently this link will be active for 48 hours.
<br />
<br />Best Regards
