<b>VALD news, 2008 April 23 (default configuration) </b>
<br />
<br />
The default configuration for the VALD ems service was updated.
Certain high excitation lines where not extracted because
of their lower excitation potential being higher than the
internal (historical) limit of 50eV. 
Thus we raised the maximum allowed excitation potential for
the lower level to 100eV.
