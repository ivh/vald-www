<h3>New VALD front-end</h3>

<p>Welcome to the new VALD! The website was put on new technical underpinnings. Everything should feel familiar but
please note that</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>You do not need to register anew, but to set a password. Simply leave it empty the first time
 you try logging in, and you will get an activation link to your email. This allows you to
 set the password that you then use for future logins.</li>
<li>Under "My Requests" you can now see the status and download links of your queries.</li>
<li>The "Modify"-link allows to re-fill the fiedls with the values from an earlier query, then edit and re-submit.</li>
<li>Requests are now handled immediately and and in parallel, so results should appear quicker. Some queries can
 however still take minutes to finish.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
For feedback and bug-reports, please feel free to contact us the usual way.
