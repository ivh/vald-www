<h3>Hyperfine Structure splitting is now in VALD3</h3>

<p>From now on VALD3 has the option to include the HFS splitting into the extraction
result. The new option is supported by the Web interface (look for HFS splitting
button) or via new extraction option "HFS splitting" to be included into the EMS
request. The splitting constants and the corresponding bibliography were
collected by Yuri Pakhomov and presented in

Pakhomov, Ryabchikova and Piskunov, 2019, Astronomy Reports, 63, 1010</a>.

<p>The output stream is sorted in wavelengths so that the HFS components may appear
interleaved by other transitions. At this point we fully support the following
extraction modes: <i>Extract All</i>, <i>Extract Element</i> and
<i>Extract Stellar</i>. <i>Showline</i> will follow in a few days.

<p>We have decided to start with HFS splitting as an option. Once we get your
feedback and check that things are working fine (even though we spent several
months testing this option) we will add HFS splitting to default extraction.
Then, to turn HFS splitting off you would have to uncheck the corresponding box in the
Web interface or specify "no HFS splitting" in the EMS request. 

<p>Enjoy!
