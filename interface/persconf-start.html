<h3>Personal Configuration of $fullname</h3>
<hr>
In the form below you can change the selection of linelists and the
weights that are being used when extracting from the VALD database.
The higher the weight, the more emphasis is given on that aspect during
extraction. It is also possible to disable some of the linelists.

<p>Use the 'Edit' links to modify the parameters of a certain linelist.
Parameters that are different from the VALD default values are shown on a <span
class="modified_data">RED</span> background. You can also revert the parameters
to the default VALD values.

<p>Any linelists that were recently added to VALD will automatically appear in
your personal configuration file below. However, these linelists will be listed
as inactive. Similarly, linelists that no longer are part of VALD will
automatically be removed for your personal configuration.

<p>For a list of references, please consult the <a
href="http://www.astro.uu.se/valdwiki/VALD3linelists"
target="_top">table of line lists with links to references.</a>
